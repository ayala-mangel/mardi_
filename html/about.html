          Mardi Gras' holiday is celebrated throughout Louisiana, including the
          city of New Orleans. The festivities are concentrated for about two
          weeks before and during the week of Pentecost, the day before Ash
          Wednesday (the beginning of borrowing in the Western Christian
          tradition). There is usually one big parade each day (weather
          permitting); Many days there are some big processions. The biggest and
          most complex parades take place in the last five days of the Mardi
          Gras season. In the past week, many events have taken place throughout
          New Orleans and nearby communities, including processions and balls
          (some of them masquerade). The parades in New Orleans are organized by
          social clubs called Cruises; Most of them follow the schedule of the
          same parade and route each year. The early Krewes based were the Krewe
          Mistick of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Mummus and the
          Krewe of Proteus. Some modern "super-caravans" are known for holding
          big parades and events, such as Carva from Andimion (known mainly for
          celebrity names as great marshals for their processions), Carva from a
          cup (also known as celebrities by the name of their kings), as well as
          the Zulu Auxiliary Club -American mostly krewe. Floating riders
          traditionally throw shots into the crowds. The most common injections
          are strings of colored, double plastic beads, decorated plastic
          "injection cups," moon pies, and small cheap toys, but injections can
          also include lingerie and fainter items. Large groups keep track of
          the procession and route schedule each year.While many tourists center
          their carnival season activities on Bourbon Street and in New Orleans
          Dauphin, large processions originated in the Uptown and Mid-City
          counties and operated a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal
          Street, on the upstream side of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras day
          traditionally ends with a "court meeting" between Rex and Komus. Some
