          <h2>Here you will get information about Mardi Gras?</h2>
          <p>
            Mardi Gras' holiday is celebrated throughout Louisiana, including
            the city of New Orleans. The festivities are concentrated for about
            two weeks before and during the week of Pentecost, the day before
            Ash Wednesday (the beginning of borrowing in the Western Christian
            tradition). There is usually one big parade each day (weather
            permitting); Many days there are some big processions. The biggest
            and most complex parades take place in the last five days of the
            Mardi Gras season. In the past week, many events have taken place
            throughout New Orleans and nearby communities, including processions
            and balls (some of them masquerade). The parades in New Orleans are
            organized by social clubs called Cruises; Most of them follow the
            schedule of the same parade and route each year. The early Krewes
            based were the Krewe Mistick of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
            Knights of Mummus and the Krewe of Proteus. Some modern
            "super-caravans" are known for holding big parades and events, such
            as Carva from Andimion (known mainly for celebrity names as great
            marshals for their processions), Carva from a cup (also known as
            celebrities by the name of their kings), as well as the Zulu
            Auxiliary Club -American mostly krewe. Floating riders traditionally
            throw shots into the crowds. The most common injections are strings
            of colored, double plastic beads, decorated plastic "injection
            cups," moon pies, and small cheap toys, but injections can also
            include lingerie and fainter items. Large groups keep track of the
            procession and route schedule each year.While many tourists center
            their carnival season activities on Bourbon Street and in New
            Orleans Dauphin, large processions originated in the Uptown and
            Mid-City counties and operated a route along St. Charles Avenue and
            Canal Street, on the upstream side of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras
            day traditionally ends with a "court meeting" between Rex and Komus.

            LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American
            politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana since May
            7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office.
            Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New
            Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.
            <br />

            Early life and education Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los
            Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier
            University of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She
            attended an executive training program at the Harvard Kennedy
            School.
            <br />

            Broadmoor neighborhood work Cantrell returned to New Orleans in
            1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she joined
            the board of the Broadmoor Improvement Association and became
            president of the association in 2004. After the 2005 levee failures
            in Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor
            neighborhood flooded severely and remained mostly deserted for
            months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back
            Commission, a blue-ribbon panel convened by then-mayor Ray Nagin,
            released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other
            New Orleans neighborhoods to be converted into greenspace. In her
            role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with residents
            and local religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's
            recommendation. She also helped enlist returning Broadmoor residents
            in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.
            <br />

            Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan
            from 2006 through 2012. She and fellow residents formed the
            Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of
            the Andrew H. Wilson school. She served as a founding board member
            of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community development
            corporation that provided case management and other social services
            for returning residents. She was involved with residents' efforts to
            reopen Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million
            grant from the Carnegie Endowment. She created a partnership between
            the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the
            Annunciation, which provided the neighborhood association with
            office space and hosted volunteer groups. She also formed a
            partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and her
            home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the Broadmoor
            Art and Wellness Center.
