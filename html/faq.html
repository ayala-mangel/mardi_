                Mardi Gras 2023 is in the history books and this morning many
                are going out to get their ashes on Ash Wednesday. Mardi Gras,
                French for Fat Tuesday, is also known as Shrove Tuesday, from
                the English term "Shrovetide." the last day before Lent. The day
                after Fat Tuesday, Ash Wednesday, is a day of fasting (having
                only one large meal with no snacks throughout the day) and
                abstinence (abstaining from red meat) for Catholics. It is also
                a day of reflection for many in New Orleans, a very Catholic
                city. (More info about the Catholic practices of Lent)
                Traditionally, we give up something during the Lenten season to
                commemorate Jesus' 40-day fast in the Judaean Desert. It's a
                period of preparation to celebrate the Lord's Resurrection at
                Easter. It allows us to think about what we can give up and how
                we can serve others in order to be closer to God. Ash Wednesday
                is the beginning of a season of a season of fasting and prayer
                ending on Easter Sunday. We go to church and get ashes on our
                forehead to show penance -- the priest blesses us in the sign of
                a cross, symbolizing ashes to ashes, dust to dust. (Some
                non-Catholic churches in New Orleans even have drive-through
                lines where you can get ashes without getting out of your car –
                no crazier, reallly, than drive-thru daiquiri shops.) Catholics
                used to give up meat (and even dairy) during all of Lent (not
                just on Fridays). We would always say it isn’t really such a
                sacrifice in New Orleans when you consider our love for, and the
                abundance of, fresh Gulf seafood. Going to a crawfish boil on
                the weekend is hardly the same as putting on a hairshirt or
                sleeping on a rack. Still, we try to give up what we love most
                (beignets, chocolate, lattes, soft drinks, smokes if we still
                got 'em, etc.). We Google “things to give up for Lent” and
                settle on something personally meaningful. Still, Lent is the
                one time of year it’s okay to be a quitter.

                This year, the Rex Organization, also known as the School of
                Design, is celebrating its 150th Mardi Gras season. In honor of
                this historic event, The Louisiana State Museum is presenting a
                special exhibit at the Presbytere in Jackson Square, showcases
                the artistry, innovation, economic, and philanthropic history of
                the krewe. This is your chance to view costumes, throws, and
                other artifacts. Watch fascinating footage of the parade over
                the years. You can also view a time-lapse video detailing float
                construction. (The krewe's Royal Artist will be making a float
                inside of the museum itself.) And you’ll learn how Rex's Pro
                Bono Publico Foundation helped revitalize the New Orleans Public
                School system after Hurricane Katrina. Along with the exhibit,
                this installation will offer lectures, family days with hands-on
                activities, and sensory-friendly programs for those with autism
                and other developmental disorders. Learn more and get tickets.

                While the next Mardi Gras isn’t until February 21, 2023, krewe
                leaders in the city have a big question: Will their parades will
                be shortened as they were in 2022 or will they go back to their
                traditional lengths and routes? Apparently, the jury is still
                out. City Hall is working on an answer and, since Covid is no
                longer an issue for groups in New Orleans, we expect things will
                be back to normal. Shortened routes last year affected hotels,
                restaurants, bars and venues on traditional parade routes.
                Hopefully, we'll all be able to view the 2023 parades on their
                usual routes and make it a full evening with planned
                parties/dinners/events before and after the parade. For ideas,
                see our Mardi Gras Packages page. City Hall should get things
                moving soon. The Mayor's Mardi Gras Committee will meet again in
                October and January. Hopefully, the krewes will get their
                answers well ahead of January 6th, the official start of the
                Carnival season. According to nola.com, “If Carnival 2023 were
                to proceed at the same pace, the Endymion parade could make it
                from City Park to the Superdome in less time than it takes to
                get a 12-piece Family Meal at Popeyes
